# SARS-CoV-2-Biggest-Economies-Analysis
How does the world's biggest economies cope with COVID-19 until April 2020

## 1. Installations
- Python 3, Anaconda3, Jupyter Notebook
- libraries (already present) pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn

## 2. Motivations

A worldwide monitoring of the course of the pandemic is made possible by the provision of what is probably the most widely used data set at present (Johns Hopkins University: COVID19 dataset). It reports on a daily basis the total number of confirmed infections, recoveries and deaths. This dataset will be used, to answer the questions of how the worldâ€™s biggest economies are coping with the pandemic since the day of the outbreak (date from which more than 100 cases were reported).
